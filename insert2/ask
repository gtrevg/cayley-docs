I have a few question regarding [this code](https://github.com/oren/test-cayley/blob/f172d111804dcf380b9d42535a7714eaec662e35/insert2/main.go) that inserts admins into my cayley:

1. why transactions? so if something fail it will rollback?
2. why IRI for subjects and predicates - `	t.AddQuad(quad.Make(quad.IRI(uuid), quad.IRI("is_a"), quad.String("admin"), nil))
`
3. Is the quad.String() needed? why not just string? `t.AddQuad(quad.Make(quad.IRI(uuid), quad.IRI("is_a"), quad.String("admin"), nil))`
4. Should the admin object be an IRI instead of a string? how to decide?
5. `Out()`, `In()`, and `Has()` - is it true that the first argument is always a predicate?
6. Is it accurate to say that `Regex()` and `Has()` is a way to fliter the numbers of nodes on my path object?
7. Can I see the path while I am building the query? (to help me troubleshoot issues)
8. Can someone explain [the comment in line 89](https://github.com/oren/test-cayley/blob/f172d111804dcf380b9d42535a7714eaec662e35/insert2/main.go#L89) - Use lock to make sure between check and write we don't have one slip in.


Thanks!
